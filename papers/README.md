1. [An Implementation of Werewolf Agent That does not Truly Trust LLMs (2024)](2409.01575_llm_werewolf_trust.pdf)  
   - Authors: Takehiro Sato, Shintaro Ozaki, Daisaku Yokoyama  
   - Year: 2024, arXiv:2409.01575  
   - Relevance: Rule-based gating of LLM outputs for social deduction agents, useful baseline for safety/consistency in opponent modeling.

2. [Strategy Adaptation in Large Language Model Werewolf Agents (2025)](2507.12732_strategy_adaptation_llm_werewolf.pdf)  
   - Authors: Fuya Nakamori, Yin Jou Huang, Fei Cheng  
   - Year: 2025, arXiv:2507.12732  
   - Relevance: Explicit strategy switching based on inferred roles/attitudes, directly tests opponent modeling in Werewolf.

3. [A Novel Weighted Ensemble Learning Based Agent for the Werewolf Game (2022)](2205.09813_weighted_werewolf_agent.pdf)  
   - Authors: Mohiuddeen Khan, Claus Aranha  
   - Year: 2022, arXiv:2205.09813  
   - Relevance: Pre-LLM ensemble agent that estimates others’ beliefs; serves as classic baseline for social deduction AI.

4. [Evaluating Large Language Models in Theory of Mind Tasks (2023)](2302.02083_theory_of_mind_llms.pdf)  
   - Authors: Michal Kosinski  
   - Year: 2023, arXiv:2302.02083  
   - Relevance: Measures ToM performance of LLMs; establishes measurement batteries for belief inference relevant to opponent modeling.

5. [CAMEL: Communicative Agents for "Mind" Exploration of Large Language Model Society (2023)](2303.17760_camel.pdf)  
   - Authors: Guohao Li, Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, Hani Itani, Dmitrii Khizbullin, Bernard Ghanem  
   - Year: 2023, arXiv:2303.17760  
   - Relevance: Multi-agent role-play framework showing emergent cooperation and persona modeling; informs scaffolding for social deduction agents.
